            <p>I am passionate about web development and UI design. My academic background includes a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science
               from Pondicherry University (2022-2024) which has equipped me with a solid foundation in software development.
            I have developed dynamic web applications  and  front-end prototypes
             , leveraging tools like MERN Stack, Figma and GitHub for seamless design integration.
             I have also gained valuable hands-on experience in setting up and calibrating advanced technologies, such as 3D printers, as part of a collaborative team project.</p>
